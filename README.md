# Book-Recommendation-System.

Recommendation systems are used extensively by the e-commerce platform to suggest a similar item to our purchase or items bought by similar customers. Recommendation systems are helpful in the customization of customers' preferences based on their previous choices. The different ways to come up with recommendation systems are namely,
* Collaborative Filtering
* Content-Based Recommendation 
* Hybrid Recommendations

# Problem Statement.

The problem statement for the recommendation project is to recommend books to the users with the help of the data we have. To build a recommendation system in python, we try out different approaches such as,

* SVD(Singular Value Decomposition) - Matrix factorization is an extensively used model to build collaborative filtering types of recommendation. In this model, we try to predict the books that haven't been read before by the user, and the results are recommended based on the predicted ratings.
* Using Cosine Similarity - In Collaborative filtering with cosine similarity, we try to find similar customers using the cosine distance between the items. The recommendations are books read by similar users with higher ratings.
The book recommendation system also uses cosine similarity to make recommendations based on book titles, authors, and book index-level recommendations.

# Steps involved in Book-Recommendation-System.
The main objective of this project is to build a recommendation system in machine learning for users based on similar user ratings for books, author-based, and item-based approaches. 

The different steps involved in the project are:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Handling Missing and null values.
* Data preprocessing
* Machine learning model Implementation
>* Collaborative filtering Using Cosine Similarity
>* Recommendations using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
>* Item-based Recommendation
>* Author-based Recommendation
>>* Recommendations using K-Nearest Neighbours
